Product,Description
Impackt BWMULT,"Impackt BWMULT is a boiler All-in-One product with extra sulfite and Return Line Treatment. If used as a stand alone program, adjust feed rate as needed for proper sulfite and condensate pH control."
Impackt BWINT,"Impackt BWINT is a solid concentrate blend containing polymer, phosphate and alkalinity booster, that acts as dispersant, designed to keep heat exchanger. It should be use for applications containing < 20 ppm of total hardness in feedwater. surfaces clean and free of scale and sludge."
Impackt BWO2,"Impackt BWO2 is a solid blend containing de-characterized sodium sulfite, sodium lignosulfonate, and erythorbate, designed to reduce oxygen and general corrosion in boiler water systems. "
Impackt BW COND1,Impackt BW COND1 is a solid concentrate formulation of DEAE designed to minimize corrosion in condensate lines by balancing pH. Feed rate is dependent upon amount of condensate return and feedwater alkalinity. FDA (21 CFR) section 173 limits dosage to not exceed 15 ppm as active in steam and excluding use of such steam in contact with milk and milk products.
Impackt BW COND2,"Impackt BW COND2 is a triple component neutralizing amines designed to minimize corrosion in condensate lines by balancing the pH, the addition of an oxygen corrosion inhibitor. It could elevate condensate pH to over 9.0 resulting in yellow metals corrosion so the product should be used in a control dosage."
Impackt BW ALK,"Impackt BW ALK is a concentrated solid caustic for alkalinity and pH control, designed to act as an Alkalinity booster."
BLB9534,BLB 9534 is a Polyphosphate/Polymer designed for scale control and defoamer for prevention of carry-over.
BLB9547,"BLB 9547 is a blend of dispersants, sequestrants, scale inhibitors, an oxygen scavenger, and a neutralizing amine, designed for small-to-medium sized boiler water systems as a All-in-one treatment product."
BLB9582,"BLB 9582 is a concentrated blend of phosphate along synthetic and natural sequestering and dispersing agents, designed to prevent boiler and feedline deposits."
BLB9708,BLB 9708 is an aqueous blend of 2 neutralizing amines suitable for use in a wide variety of applications where condensate corrosion due to low pH is a problem. FDA (21 CFR) section 173 limits dosage to not exceed 10 ppm in steam.
"BLB9708 (AVT), BLB9715 (Non-AVT)",BLB 9708 is an aqueous blend of 2 neutralizing amines suitable for use in a wide variety of applications where condensate corrosion due to low pH is a problem. FDA (21 CFR) section 173 limits dosage to not exceed 10 ppm in steam. BLB 9715 is an aqueous blend of three neutralizing amines that provides optimum protection for complex systems in corrosion control. FDA (21 CFR) section 173 limits dosage to not exceed 10 ppm in steam and excluding use of such steam in contact with milk and milk products.
BLB9612,"BLB 9612 is an oxygen scavenger for food industry, with quick reaction and passivation of metal (magnetite)."
BLB9605,"BLB 9605 is a volatile neutralizing amine and oxygen scavenger that provides more comprehensive steam and condensate corrosion inhibition. Promotes the formation of magnetite, does not have the same health hazards as hydrazine."
BLB9602,BLB 9602 is a bisulphite solution with catalyst for rapid oxygen scavenging. Is recommended to avoid using it in contact with sulfur sensitive catalysts.
BLB9626,BLB 9626 is a liquid catalyzed sodium bisulfite designed to protect boiler and feedwater systems from oxygen attack. It is also useful in the wet storage of boilers to provide protection from oxygen attack.
BLB3876,"BLB 3876 is a supplemental defoamer compatible with all alkaline formulations, designed to control boiler foaming to reduce carryover and improve steam purity."
BLB9593,Bulab 9593 is an aqueous 25% sodium hydroxide solution. Typical dosage is approx. 100 ppm. Used as an alkalinity booster.
"BLB9626, BLB9602 (Single Active)",BLB 9626 is a liquid catalyzed sodium bisulfite designed to protect boiler and feedwater systems from oxygen attack. It is also useful in the wet storage of boilers to provide protection from oxygen attack. BLB 9602 is a bisulphite solution with catalyst for rapid oxygen scavenging. Is recommended to avoid using it in contact with sulfur sensitive catalysts.
